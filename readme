The description of programs "radiants.f" and "elements.f"
---------------------------------------------------------

radiants.f
==========
Using the orbital elements, q, e, omega, Omega, and i, this code
calculates: solar longitude, right ascension and declination of
geocentric radiant, and geocentric velocity. The calculated quantities
are compared with their observed counterparts and too large deviations
are written to an extra output file (see below).

INPUT:
   (1) data file "inparams.rad" with the parameters characterizing the
specific requirements. The description of each value that must be
specified in this file is given in the previous line directly in
"inparams.rad";
   (2) data file with the mean geocentric and orbital characteristics
of individual solutions of showers (its name in the template is
"allshowers11jan2023.db"; otherwise the name can be specified in
"inparams.rad"). This file should be prepared before the running of the
program. The characteristics of one solution should be given in one
line. There must be 12 columns with 12 parameters. These are:

IAU - the IAU No. of shower {integer}
sol. - the number of shower solution {integer}
LS - mean solar longitude [deg] {real}
R.A. - mean right ascension of geocentric radiant [deg] {real}
DEC - mean declination of geocentric radiant [deg] {real}
Vg - mean geocentric velocity [km/s] {real}
q - mean perihelion distance [au] {real}
e - mean eccentricity [1] {real}
omega - mean argument of perihelion [deg] {real}
Omega - mean longitude of ascending node [deg] {real}
i - mean inclination [deg] {real}
n - number of meteors in given solution {integer}

OUTPUT:
   (1) List of the calculated geocentric quantities of all considered
showers (all their solutions). Each solution is characterized with the
IAU No. of shower and the solution number. In the third to sixth columns
there are given: solar longitude [deg], right ascension and declination
of geocentric radiant [deg], and geocentric velocity [km/s]. These are
given in two lines, whereby the observed values (i.e. the values
published by the original author) are in the first and the calculated
values in the second line. In the last columns of the second line, there
is indicated the method of the modification of orbit to cross the orbit
of the Earth (Q, B, W, A, H, P; the description can be found in
Neslusan L. et al.: 1998, A&A 331, 411; 1998A&A...331..411N). The name
of this file in the template is "check_geo.d"; it can be specified in
the input file "inparams.rad".
   (2) List of parameters, which were found to be outside of the
specified tolerance (the specification should be done in
"inparams.rad"). Each deviation is given in one line; this line contains
the IAU No. of shower, number of its solution, observed value of the
erroneous parameter and the corresponding calculated value. The name of
this file in the template is "errors_geo.inf"; it can be specified in
"inparams.rad".
   (3) "debug.rad" - this file is written only when its occurrence is
required in "inparams.rad". It contains all the calculated parameters,
by all methods for every solution. Basically, there are three values in
a given line: observed, calculated for the post-perihelion, and
calculated for the pre-perihelion arc of the solution's mean orbit.
Either the calculated value for the post-perihelion or that for the
pre-perihelion arc should agree with its observed counterpart.

elements.f
==========
Using the solar longitude, equatorial coordinates of geocentric radiant,
and geocentric velocity, the program calculates the orbital elements,
q, e, omega, Omega, and i. The calculated quantities are compared with
their observed counterparts and too large deviations are written to an
extra output file (see below).

INPUT:
   (1) data file "inparams.ele" with the parameters characterizing the
specific requirements. The description of each value that must be
specified in this file is given in the previous line;
   (2) data file with the mean geocentric and orbital characteristics of
individual solutions of showers (its name in the template is
"allshowers11jan2023.db"; otherwise the name can be specified in
"inparams.ele"). This file should be prepared before the running of the
program. It is the same as the input file for the program "radiants.f".

OUTPUT:
   (1) List of the calculated prbital elements of all considered showers
(all their solutions). Each solution is characterized with the IAU No.
of shower and the solution number. In the third to seventh columns there
are given: perihelion distance [au], eccentricity, arguments of
perihelion [deg], longitude of ascending node [deg], and inclination
[deg]. These are given in two lines, whereby the observed values are in
the first and the calculated values in the second line. The name of this
file in the template is "check_orb.d"; it can be specified in the input
file "inparams.ele".
   (2) List of parameters, which were found to be outside of the
specified tolerance (in "inparams.ele"). Each deviation is given in one
line; this line contains the IAU No. of shower, number of its solution,
observed value of the erroneous parameter and the corresponding
calculated value. The name of this file in the template is
"errors_orb.inf"; it can be specified in "inparams.ele".
